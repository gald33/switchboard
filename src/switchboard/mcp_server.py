"""MCP server exposing a Switchboard hub as tools.

This speaks the MCP stdio protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout) directly
rather than through an SDK. The tools-only subset is small and stable, and
implementing it here means the bridge has no dependency beyond ``httpx`` and
cannot break when an SDK renames its API between majors.

Run it as ``switchboard-mcp``. Everything is configured by environment:

    SWITCHBOARD_URL        hub base URL
    SWITCHBOARD_TOKEN      bearer token
    SWITCHBOARD_WORKSPACE  workspace to join
    SWITCHBOARD_AGENT_ID   override the inferred agent id

stdout is the protocol channel — every diagnostic goes to stderr.
